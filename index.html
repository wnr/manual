              Introduction
            </h2>
            <p>
              Congratulations on choosing your Honda CRF motocross motorcycle.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you own a Honda, you’re part of a 
              worldwide family of satisfied customers – people
              who appreciate Honda’s reputation for building
              quality into every product.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your CRF is a high performance racing 
              motorcycle that utilizes the latest motocross 
              technology and is intended for competition use in
              sanctioned, closed-course events by experienced
              riders only.
            </p>
            <p>
              Be aware that motocross is a physically 
              demanding sport that requires more than just a
              fine motorcycle. To do well, you must be 
              excellent physical condition and be a skillful
              rider. For the best results, work diligently on
              your physical conditioning and practice 
              frequently.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before riding, take time to get acquainted with
              your CRF and how it works. To protect your
              investment, we urge you to take responsibility for
              keeping your CRF well maintained. Scheduled
              service is a must, of course. But it’s just as
              important to observe the break-in guidelines, and
              perform all the pre-ride and other periodic checks
              detailed in this manual.
            </p>
            <p>
              You should also read the owner’s manual before
              you ride. It’s full of facts, instructions, safety
              information, and helpful tips. To make it easy to
              use, the manual contains a table of contents, a
              detailed list of topics at the beginning of each
              section, and an index at the back of the book.
            </p>
            <p>
              As you read this manual, you will find 
              information that is preceded by a 
              symbol. This information is intended to help you
              avoid damage to your Honda, other property, or
              the environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unless you are mechanically qualified and have
              the proper tools, you should see your Honda
              dealer for the service and adjustment procedures
              discussed in this manual.
            </p>
            <p>
              The official Honda Service Manual for your CRF
              is available (page 156). It is the same manual
              your dealer uses. If you plan to do any service
              on your CRF beyond the standard maintenance
              procedures in this manual, you will find the
              Service Manual a valuable reference.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have any questions, or if you ever need a
              special service or repairs, remember that your
              Honda dealer knows your CRF best and is
              dedicated to your complete satisfaction.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please report any change of address or ownership
              to your Honda dealer so we will be able to 
              contact you concerning important production
              information.

            <h3>Maintenance Safety</h3>
              <p>
                Keeping your CRF well-maintained is absolutely
                essential to your safety. It’s also a good way to
                get maximum performance during each moto.
                Careful pre-ride inspections and good
                maintenance are especially important because
                your CRF is designed to be ridden in off-road
                competition.
              </p>
              <p>
                Remember, proper maintenance is your 
                responsibility. Be sure to inspect your CRF
                before each ride and follow the Maintenance
                Schedule in this section. 
              </p>

            <h4>Important Safety Precautions</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Make sure the engine is off before you begin
                any maintenance or repairs.
                This will help eliminate several potential 
                hazards:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <span class="bold">Carbon monoxide poisoning from engine
                    exhaust.</p> Be sure there is adequate ventilation
                    whenever you operate the engine.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="bold">Burns from hot motorcycle parts.</span> Let the
                    engine and exhaust system cool before 
                    touching. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="bold">Injury from moving parts.</span> Do not run the
                    engine unless instructed to do so. 
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Read the instructions before you begin, and
                make sure you have the tools and skills
                required.
              </li>
              <li>
                To help prevent the motorcycle from falling
                over, park it on a firm, level surface, using the
                optional work stand or a maintenance stand to
                provide support. 
              </li>
              <li>
                To reduce the possibility of a fire or 
                explosion, be careful when working around
                gasoline. Use only a non-flammable (high
                flash point) solvent such as kerosene —not
                gasoline— to clean parts. Keep cigarettes,
                sparks, and flames away from all fuel-related
                parts. 
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Engine Oil</h3>
            <p>
              Refer to <a href="#safety-precautions">Safety Precautions</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using the proper oil, and regularly checking,
              adding, and changing oil will help extend the
              service life of the engine’s life. Even the best oil
              wears out. Changing oil helps get rid of dirt and
              deposits. Operating the engine with old or dirty
              oil can damage your engine. Running the engine
              with insufficient oil can cause serious damage to
              the engine.
